## Getting Started

Follow our [Installation Guide](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/blob/main/docs/content/installation) to get the NGINX Ingress Controller up and running.

Read the [documentation](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/tree/main/docs) and [configuration](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/tree/main/examples) examples

### Project Structure

* This Ingress Controller is written in Go and supports both the open source NGINX software and NGINX Plus.
* The project follows a standard Go project layout
    * The main code is found at `cmd/nginx-ingress/`
    * The internal code is found at `internal/`
    * Build files for Docker and CI are found under `build/`
    * Deployment yaml files, and Helm files are found at `deployments/`
    * The project dependencies are found at `vendor/`. We use [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) for managing dependencies.

Note: if you’d like to implement a new feature, please consider creating a feature request issue first to start a discussion about the feature.

## Style Guides

### Git Style Guide

* Keep a clean, concise and meaningful git commit history on your branch, rebasing locally and squashing before submitting a PR
* Follow the guidelines of writing a good commit message as described here https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/ and summarised in the next few points
    * In the subject line, use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
    * In the subject line, use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
    * Limit the subject line to 72 characters or less
    * Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the subject line
    * Add more detailed description in the body of the git message (`git commit -a` to give you more space and time in your text editor to write a good message instead of `git commit -am`)

### Go Style Guide

* Run `gofmt` over your code to automatically resolve a lot of style issues. Most editors support this running automatically when saving a code file.
* Run `go lint` and `go vet` on your code too to catch any other issues.
* Follow this guide on some good practice and idioms for Go -  https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments
* To check for extra issues, install [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) and run `make lint` or `golangci-lint run`
